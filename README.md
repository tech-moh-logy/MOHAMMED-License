#### Measures to Prevent Unauthorized Use

1. **Obfuscation**:

   Source code may be obfuscated or encrypted to deter reverse engineering attempts. Mohammed employs sophisticated obfuscation techniques to make unauthorized extraction or modification of the source code exceedingly difficult.

2. **Access Control**:

   Access to the project's source code repository is restricted to authorized individuals only. Unauthorized access attempts will be detected and blocked, and appropriate legal action will be taken against perpetrators.

3. **Digital Rights Management (DRM)**:

   Digital rights management technologies may be implemented to protect multimedia files from unauthorized copying or redistribution. Mohammed utilizes robust DRM solutions to safeguard multimedia content from piracy and unauthorized usage.

4. **Watermarking**:

   Visual and audio content may be watermarked to deter unauthorized usage. Mohammed embeds subtle watermarks within multimedia files to trace the origin of unauthorized copies and identify infringing parties.

Any attempt to circumvent these protective measures or violate the terms of the MOHAMMED's License will be met with severe consequences, including but not limited to legal action, financial penalties, and reputational damage.
